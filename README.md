"# Card-Simulation" 

This is a card simulation program developed by me while learning coding with Deitel

The application contains two classes Card and DeckOfCards.

Card class is used for creating cards and dispaying the cards with repr and str overide methods

DeckOfCard class lets us create a deck of cards, shuffle and deal the cards

The Card_simulation.py prints the card images using matplotlib pyplot and image modules
